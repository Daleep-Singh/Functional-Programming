A1.rkt is a interpreter for tail recursive fns built in racket.  
A2.hs is a interpreter built in haskell, which is able to interpret the grammar defined in a2_types.hs. Notably, there are certain literal values defined as well as more complex expressions (addition, multiplecation, pairs, if statements, variable lookup, closures), which can be interpreted and a value provided.
